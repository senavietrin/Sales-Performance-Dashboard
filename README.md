# Sales Performance Dashboard
In this project, I performed Web Dashboard Visualization Using Google Looker Studio from a dummy dataset about sales Performance from August - December 2021
this Dashboard would visualize some metrics  such as :
- Amount of Unique Buyers
- Monthly Revenue
- Coupon Code Usage
- Revenue Contribution Map
all those metrics able to be filtered by Delivery  Country, Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), Coupon Code, and Month to customize the visualization
